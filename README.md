# Machine-Learning-Coursework-1classifier.py
This code was done as part of the coursework for the Machine Learning Module for King's College London, where I achieved 100% for this project. I have only uploaded the code that I made. This script implements a decision tree classifier and a gradient boosting classifier using decision trees. The Node class represents a decision node in the tree, while the DecisionTree class provides methods to calculate entropy, information gain, and recursively build the tree. The Classifier class uses gradient boosting to iteratively create decision trees and improve prediction accuracy. The script also includes a one_hot_encode function to convert target arrays into one-hot encoded arrays. This implementation allows for fitting the classifier to data, making predictions, and resetting the classifier for new training sessions.

-Decision Tree Classifier with Gradient Boosting Descent Model (Achieved 100%)
- Developed a decision tree classifier and gradient boosting descent model from scratch as part of an extra credit module in
machine learning.
- Implemented object-oriented programming principles, including class structure and inheritance, to create a flexible and
scalable model.
- Utilized recursion and NumPy operations for efficient algorithm implementation, achieving 100% marks for the coursework.
- The project involved pre-processing of data, feature selection, and model evaluation techniques to train Pacman to make
decisions based on provided data.
